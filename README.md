## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page



### Links

## My process

This was a much bigger challenge than I've taken on in the past. I tried to approach this from a mostly mobile first approach. I strayed from that in the middle, but tried to bring it back.

I attempted to use the `:before` element and a coutner but I could never get the spacing to cooeprate with being on it's on line. I tried adding a `<br>` but just could never get it to line up.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While I still have a ways to go on the collapseable menu, it was good to implement this and include JS and also feel like I had a good idea on what the JS was doing and anticipating what was to be done as I went through the tutorial. 

I ended up using named segments in my grid as that was generally what I found to be the best way. Initially I had planned to have a grid of 9, 3 by 3, but again I could not get the spacing to cooperate for 3 columns, there was just way too mucvh white space. 

### Continued development

I want to focus on and add:

- Mobile First
- SASS
- More Javascript
- Using the BEM method to have an overall cleaner set of code.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell Responsive Navbar Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjPxtv9SVKQZm_huHpDEgLz0&index=6) - This was really helpful with the collapsing menu.
